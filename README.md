# Elements Interface for external analysis packages

DataJoint Element for interoperability with other software. DataJoint Elements
collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience
experiments. Typical Elements are modular pipelines for data storage and processing with
corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a
fully functional pipeline. Element Interface is home to a number of utilities that make
this possible.

Installation and usage instructions can be found at the
[Element documentation](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-interface).
